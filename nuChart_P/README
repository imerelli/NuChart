### NuChart-II ###
##################
 
NuChart-II is a C++ software designed to explore, annotate and visualize Hi-C data in a gene-centric fashion.
NuChart-II is highly optimized to fully exploit the parallel computing capabilities exposed by modern computers, 
and results in a fast and accurate tool for DNA exploration. 

 -- Requirements
Make sure your compiler is up to date and compatible with C++11 (gcc 4.7 or above, icc 12.1 or above)
Make sure you have libgsl2 and libgsl-dev installed (in Debian-based and Ubuntu, simply install them
through apt-get)
Make sure you have graphviz installed, with binaries in your PATH, otherwise graphs won't be drown
automatically.


 -- Compile
COMPILE with make: make [options]

 -- OPTIONS:
 	[DEBUG]:			compile for Debugging, with -g and NO optimisations
 	[EXPINTER]:			expand search to inter-genic neighbours.
 	[TESTn]:			where 'n' is 1-4, enables features and more textual outputs for specific testing situations (EXPERIMENTAL)
 	
 -- EXAMPLES:
  	make				compile with compiler optimisations (-O3)
	make DEBUG=YES		compile for Debugging, with -g and NO optimisations
	make EXPINTER=YES	enable search for inter-genic neighbours

---------------------------------------------------------------

 -- USAGE:	./nuchart -S[sam-file] -W[num-workers] -L[search-level] -G[genes] -g[grain] -E[edge-prob] -P[plot] -C[coords] -H[help]

 -- DESCRIPTION
	[help]:			prints this help message and exits.
	[sam-file]:		path to the file of nucleotide sequence alignments (DEFAULT is '~/datasets/LiebermanAiden.sam')
	[num-workers]:	number of worker threads to be used (DEFAULT is 1, i.e. sequential)
	[search-level]:	deepness of the search - e.g.: 1 = direct neighbours; 2 = neighbours of neighbours, etc. (DEFAULT is 1)
	[genes]:		entrezID or symbol of the starting gene. There can be more than one gene. (REQUIRED)
	[grain]:		decide the grain for the parallel execution (DEFAULT IS 0, which means 'num_tasks/num_workers')
	[edge-prob]:	edges with probability below this threshold will not be considered (DEFAULT is 0, which means
					compute score for ALL edges. Allowed probability values range from 0.2 to 1)
	[plot]:			plot graphs using GraphViz
	[coords]:		cluster of Genes. use all the genes found within given coordinates. Chromosome must be specified
					(es: -C chr7:27126219,27250333)

 -- EXAMPLES:
	./nuchart -S ~/datasets/SSRR400266.sam -W 16 -L 3 -G 7157 2035 4622
		This will run NuChart over the given SAM file, using 16 worker and iterating until
		neighbours of neighbours of neighbours of the starting genes are found.
		Graph construction begins from the 3 specified gene IDs.

	./nuchart -L 2 -W 8 -C chr7:27126219,27250333
		This will run NuChart over the default SAM file, using 8 workers and iterating until
		neighbours of neighbours are found. Graph construction begins with the genes found within the given coordinates.
		
	./nuchart -L 2 -W 8 -C IGL
		This will run NuChart over the default SAM file, using 8 workers and iterating until
		neighbours of neighbours are found. Graph construction begins with the genes found within the specified cluster.

	./nuchart -G TP53 -L 2 -E 0.6 -P
		This will run NuChart over the default SAM file in sequential mode, iterating until
		neighbours of neighbours are found. Graph construction begins with the gene of given symbol.
		Score for Edges with probability lower than 0.6 will not be plotted.
		Resulting neighbour graphs will be plotted using GraphViz (if installed, otherwise it saves the .dot file) and 
		saved in a folder named 'gViz_GENENAME'.
